# CMPLXSY-art
An art inspired by the everything bagel from  the film Everything, Everywhere All at Once (2022). Using a simple code to represent the everything bagel.

We hope that the bagel that looms over our lives, reminds us to be kind and embrace the love and beauty that our family gives. Let us remind ourselves the perception of the universe is not always our own perception. That the meaning in life is for us to give its own and to not relay on the universe. Similarly to a complex system that in the big picture it may seem pointless, no meaning. But the uncertainty of the turtles gives such excitement because it defines itself. That no code implemented can predict its move. Everytime its different so lets be different together.
